Running the program:
1. Execute `make` to compile the program
2. Execute `p1` script to execute the program

Input:
The application accepts a file name as argument 0 to be processed.

Output:
All output is printed to the console.

Overall Design:
The Parser is a recursive-descent parser with backtracking.
Each production rule is tested. If it fails, backtrack and try the next rule. 
If no rule matches, then the parse is failed.
